Aitri structures AI-assisted development into a five-phase pipeline: requirements, architecture, test design, implementation, and deployment. Each phase produces a versioned artifact. You review and approve before the next phase starts.

Works with any agent that reads stdout: Claude Code, Codex, Gemini Code, Opencode, or any shell-based workflow.

## Pipeline

```
IDEA.md
    |
[optional] Discovery / Facilitator           > 00_DISCOVERY.md
    |
Phase 1   / Product Manager                  > 01_REQUIREMENTS.json
    |
[optional] UX / UX Designer                  > 01_UX_SPEC.md
    |
Phase 2   / Software Architect               > 02_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md
    |
Phase 3   / QA Engineer                      > 03_TEST_CASES.json
    |
Phase 4   / Full-Stack Developer             > 04_IMPLEMENTATION_MANIFEST.json
    |
          * Verify                           > 04_TEST_RESULTS.json

## Quick Start

```bash
mkdir my-app && cd my-app
aitri init

# Edit IDEA.md, or run aitri wizard for a guided interview

aitri run-phase 1
aitri complete 1
aitri approve 1

# Repeat for phases 2, 3, 4

aitri verify-run
aitri verify-complete

aitri run-phase 5
aitri complete 5 && aitri approve 5
```

## Commands

### Core loop

| Command | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `aitri init` | Initialize project, creates IDEA.md and the `.aitri` state file |
| `aitri wizard` | Interactive interview to build IDEA.md (quick / standard / deep) |
| `aitri run-phase <phase>` | Print phase briefing to stdout, your agent reads and acts on it |
| `aitri complete <phase>` | Validate artifact schema and record the phase as done |
| `aitri approve <phase>` | Approve with a human review checklist, unlocks the next phase |
| `aitri reject <phase> --feedback "..."` | Reject with feedback, incorporated into the next briefing |

### Test gate

| Command | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `aitri verify-run` | Run the test suite, parse TC results, write `04_TEST_RESULTS.json` |
| `aitri verify-complete` | Confirm all TCs pass and all FRs are covered, unlocks Phase 5 |

### Status

| Command | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `aitri status` | Show pipeline state |

Phases: `1-5`, `discovery`, `ux`, `review`

Full command reference: `aitri help`

## Adopting an Existing Project

```bash
cd existing-project

# Guided path
aitri adopt scan
# agent writes ADOPTION_SCAN.md (diagnostic) and IDEA.md (stabilization plan)
aitri adopt apply
# then run the pipeline from Phase 1 as usual

# Direct entry, skip the scan
aitri adopt apply --from 4    # has code, no formal specs
aitri adopt apply --from 1    # start from requirements on an existing codebase

# Upgrade an existing Aitri project
aitri adopt --upgrade
```

---

## Compatible Agents

| Agent | Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| Claude Code | Run `aitri run-phase N` in your session, Claude reads stdout |
| Codex CLI | Same |
| Gemini Code | Same |
| Opencode | Same |
| Any shell agent | Aitri writes to stdout, the agent writes files |
